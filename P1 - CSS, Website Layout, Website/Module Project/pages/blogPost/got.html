                    Game of Thrones <em>(or GoT)</em> is the name of a highly acclaimed and critical TV show based off of the Ice of Song and Fire series created by George R.R. Martin.
                    While the TV show had shown promise in the earlier seasons when it roughly followed the storyline described in the books, the show sporadically fell apart as soon as it had no more books to cover.
                    Until the very last season, audience was on the edge of their seats in excitement for the next installment.
                    However, as soon as the last season started to air, the ratings plummeted and GoT became just another show in this sea of mass media consumption.

                    After a disappointing finale, fans have lost any interest in the series.
                    One might think that there can be hope in the books for closure.
                    But considering the enormous time it is taking for George R.R. Martin to release the second last book, the book fans aren't hopeful for closure either.
                    The whole saga of GoT has been forgotten to the tumultous nature of the internet.

                    Was the reason for such failure lie on the internet that finds it hard to stay on a particular media or event for more than a week?
                    Or was it due to how horribly the series decided to end on the screen?
                    Or maybe it was the fault of George R.R. Martin for not have a greater hold on the direction of the show?
                    Whatever the reason may be, one thing is for certain.
                    It doesn't matter how popular or well-acclaimed you are now.
                    <strong>People will only remember or forget about you based on the way you end.</strong>

                            Rayed is a highly motivated individual.
                            Constantly trying to create the best content he can.
                            However, this perfectionist trait leads him to take a bit longer than others to complete tasks.
                            But once he is done, you can expect the final product to be the best.
