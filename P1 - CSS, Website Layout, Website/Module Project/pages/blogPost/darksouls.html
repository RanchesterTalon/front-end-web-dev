                    Dark Souls is a game series created by FROM Software, a Japan-based video game company.
                    It has been created with a very simple gaming loop:
                    <strong>You die, you restart from the last bonfire that you rested at.</strong>
                    While this loop is simple, there is a deeper meaning that can be drawn from it.
                    The main drive of this loop is that you fail and you try again. 
                    You try to get back to where you had failed to regain what you had lost.
                    If you fail again before reaching there, the new spot you are trying to get back is the spot you just failed at.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While it may not be obvious until you really look into it, the loop teaches a valuable lesson.
                    Everyday we go through our own loop.
                    We wake up, we get ready, we eat, we work, and then we go to sleep.
                    While there may be variations on this format from person to person, these actions will be there.
                    For a lot of people, they face failures on a particular day.
                    The next day they have to come back to that same failure and have to push through it.
                    Eventually, that person reaches a goal that they had set.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The similarity between the game and the real world can be easily interpreted now.
                    No matter what struggle we face and what failures happen in the current loop of our day, tomorrow is an opportunity to face that failure again and overcome it.
                    If not, then try again. And again. And again.
                    <em>Until you finally overcome it.</em>

                        <p>
                            Rayed is a highly motivated individual.
                            Constantly trying to create the best content he can.
                            However, this perfectionist trait leads him to take a bit longer than others to complete tasks.
                            But once he is done, you can expect the final product to be the best.
