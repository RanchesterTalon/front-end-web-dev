            <p>I'm not the protagonist of a novel or anything.
                I'm just a college student who likes to read, like you could find anywhere.
                But... if, for argument's sake, you were to write a story with me in the lead role, it would certainly be... a tragedy.

                    Tokyo Ghoul is a highly-acclaimed series originally created by Sui Ishida as a comic.
                    It later got an animated adaptation that was received with lukewarm response.
                    It takes a look at a normal person named Kaneki Ken who gets thrust into a society he was once afraid of.
                    As story progresses, Kaneki experiences both societies from the frontlines, fighting for the victory of the society he is fighting for.
                    These experiences allows him to make a stand at the end to unite the two societies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The two societies are so fundamentally different from each other.
                    On one hand we have normal humans who have a special police force to eradicate the other society.
                    And the other society is a society of superhuman cannibals called Ghouls.
                    It is slightly reminiscent of pre-historic Earth where there was a society of tribal humans and fearsome animals that would hunt the humans on sight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just like how humans realized that the beasts can be tamed and made docile such that they can coexist peacefully, so does the world of Tokyo Ghoul come to a similar realization.
                    Though there are many differences that make this analogy fall apart, there is one uniting lesson that can be learned from both cases.
                    <strong>Just because you don't understand something and it seems like that thing is destroying your life, try to understand it first before completely ostracizing it as evil.</strong>

                            Constantly trying to create the best content he can.
                            However, this perfectionist trait leads him to take a bit longer than others to complete tasks.
                            But once he is done, you can expect the final product to be the best.
