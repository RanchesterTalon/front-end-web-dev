# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project requires you to create a trip journal app that retrieves information about the loaction and the user can save their trip information. 

## Instructions
Please run `npm install` in this folder and set up the .env file with the appropriate API keys. You can run the development server with the command `npm run build-dev` which will run the server on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080 "Dev Server"). However, you will need to run the Express server by running `npm run start` as the functionalities is dependant on it. If you do not wish to have two ports occupied by the app, first run `npm run build-prod` and then `npm run start` to get a dist folder which has the distribution files ready for the server. Then open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000 "Production Server") and use the app.
